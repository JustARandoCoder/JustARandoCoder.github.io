	<h1>Welcome to our Sea Of thieves loot</h1>
		<img src="images/seaofthieves.png" alt="The Sea of thieves Crew sitting at the bow of the ship in front of a good haul of loot.">
		<p> This is what happens when the <strong>BOYS</strong> get together!</p>
	<h3>The loot!</h3>
		<p>As you can see in the picture, we managed to obtain </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Four Collectors Chests</li>
			<li> One Grog Barrel</li>
			<li> 20 Villanous bounty skulls</li>
			<li> A copius amount of Mermaid Gems</li>
			<li> A plethora of other skulls</li>
			<li> And a few other items </li>
		</ul>
		<h4> Grog Barrel Shennanigans</h4>
			<p> As we were sailing past Devils roar, Alife, somehow spotted a grog Barrel on the shore. This boy decided to collect it</p>
			<p>Now this grog barrel ultimately led almost to our demise! As we were sailing, we were passing around the grog barrel and seeing it's effects and while intoxicated we were <strong>Borded!</strong></p>
			<p>A sloop had decided to attack us and ended up killing us all, as we found it impossible to fight while drunk. </p>
			<p> Now this sloop was PL level and they had an Athena Keg which would certainly sink out galleon in one fell swoop, especially if they kept us off repairs</p>
			<p>Luckily, Alfie, the man who originally brought the grog barrel onto the ship was the first to die, and thus first to respawn. </p>
			<p> Alfie's sniping skill can be defined in one word "Cracked"... He somehow, managed to shoot the athena keg while the borders were about to board us with it </p>
			<p> We ended up sinking them quite easily, despite them being pirate legends, I struggle whether to dub alife a Hero or a Villan, but I guess that's up to how you look at it </p>
			<p> And that's the story of the Grog Barrel that almost lost us 100k+ </p>
